      "            \"message\": \"Not everyone has an awesome day everyday. In this week\\u2019s podcast, Michael and Qiuyan chat about being real, human, mentors,  and even gender expectations\\n\\nRevisiting the reason why Qiuyan left a great job at Goldman to begin her entrepreneurship journey, they agreed it was the freedom to create that makes one feel more alive. There is research that backs up their view that past a certain point, you don\\u2019t want to be working for the money, and that it\\u2019s not a good measure of job satisfaction. Doing your own thing gives you the opportunity to influence decisions and your team a lot more directly, which Qiuyan feels fulfilled by and that keeps her going.\\n\\nThe flipside is that being in a small company, decisions have a much greater impact -- even small wins mean a lot, the feeling is great since it was self-determined and it brings much joy and life. The interesting dichotomy is that bad decisions also make you feel much worse, and the same thing that made you feel alive makes you feel dead. Qiuyan shared how she and her team were very disappointed, when a B2B deal they had been working very hard on for some time didn\\u2019t go through. At that point, does a leader put on a front or be truthful about one\\u2019s feelings? They conclude there has to be a balance.\\n\\nCan being vulnerable be a strength? Qiuyan recalls that the bosses and mentors she looks up to the most, are the ones who did show a human side to things. Michael brought up a great point that there some whom we work with that don\\u2019t seem to make mistakes (or at least in their head). But as all of us are human, it becomes hard to trust the things these people say or do as they\\u2019re not honest with themselves. Especially when you\\u2019re building something together, it becomes extremely problematic when people can\\u2019t follow their leadership because they don\\u2019t trust them. Qiu adds one that on the other hand, there has to be filters and limits. If one goes around moping and sobbing, the team\\u2019s energy and composure is sure to take a hit.\\n\\nSpeaking on mentors, an interesting view on gender was raised. No matter what we agree or disagree on, there are some societal norms that exist regardless of our view. Qiuyan recounts that her female mentors tend to be gentler in their approach, while the guys feel more decisive. Michael brings us a revelatory insight -- that perhaps guys feel more compelled to be more decisive because of the expectation society places on them. In contrast, women might feel more comfortable being softer, because they are confident in what they\\u2019re saying regardless of how strong they say it. In this case, gentleness is not a weakness but a strength.\\n\\nhttp://michaelwaitzepresents.com/2018/04/14/keeping-it-real-with-qiuyan-episode-04-that-makes-me-feel-alive/\"\n",

      "            \"message\": \"In this week\\u2019s episode, Michael I. Waitze and Qiuyan Tian are joined by Melvyn Yeo, an experienced investor and startup founder. \\n\\nThey begin with discussing how in the startup world, challenges and roadblocks are commonplace. A unique phenomenon is that the highs are really high, and the lows can get really low, since the stakes are high and there\\u2019s a lot of blood and sweat involved. There could be days where a misstep can seem fatal, but they agreed that it would take a collection of fatal days for it to be truly lethal.\\n\\nFailure is part of life, and no one escapes it. What is key is what do you learn from it, and how do you apply it in the future. If one tries their best, there is always a story to tell from the journey taken, and the results will be very telling over time. No one is proud of their failures, but you can be proud of how the lessons learned is what bettered yourself. \\n\\nThe startup scene is an arena where one\\u2019s resilience will be battle-tested. To thrive, no, to survive in this arena, resilience is essential. It\\u2019s something all entrepreneurs need to have in their core to pick themselves up after multiple setbacks on the journey to success.\\n\\nSpeaking on success, they talk about how money should not be the only barometer to measure it. Profit aside, one grows to realise that that culture your staff embodies and the quality of the business -- how it impacts people, can sometimes be more significant than the quantity of revenue .\\n\\nThey conclude that the attitude towards the daily grind should be a positive one, that slugging it out ultimately grows and matures you. Even in tough times where you have to make 3 steps forward and 2 steps back, you make progress at the end of the day. Surely, this adds up over time, and it will count where it matters, on the trajectory towards success.\\n\\nhttp://michaelwaitzepresents.com/2018/04/09/episode-03-what-is-failure-or-success-when-no-one-is-undefeated/\"\n",

There\\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong in a failed partnership, the most important thing is that you learn from it.
